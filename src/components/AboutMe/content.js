    description: 'So, an entire page about me huh! Well, well ðŸ˜‰ As you might have guessed it by now, I am Vedanshi. I am a first (almost second!) year undergraduate at College of Engineering, Pune (COEP), majoring in Computer Science. Some of my interests include web development and machine learning. You can call me the jack of some trades and master of none (not yet! ðŸ˜€). In my free time I enjoy listening to music and also making some. I do not call myself the master of thoughts but I do spend quite a lot of time contemplating about why people behave the way they do or what exactly is the ultimate truth of life. Or do we even have a purpose for our existence or was it a mere coincidence? Too deep huh? ðŸ™ƒ I also believe that one is supposed to live life to their fullest.',
    description2: "Besides that, I like to consider myself as a hardworking and persistent human being and I try my best to make it true. Although I do not have an external form of art to showcase my creativity I do enjoy listening and talking to people. Cause I believe that words do have enough power to influence our lives strongly. I am sometimes more ambitious than I should be, but everyone does have faults right, and so do I. So why not embrace it? ðŸ¤— Well that's about me. Wanna Connect?
